DOMAIN PATH: data/domains/blocks
DESC CLASS: detailed-first
FEEDBACK PIPELINE: landmark
GIVE PRED DESCRIPTIONS: True

ERROR MESSAGE ======================================

Error: RuntimeError, Failed to call domain model: Error during feedback generation: I have reviewed the landmark analysis and the fact that—because we allow “on b3 b1” to hold in the initial state—there is no *need* to ever touch b₁ or b₃ to achieve the goal.  In classical STRIPS/block-world, an atom that is already true in the initial state and is required in the goal is *not* a landmark.  Thus the dispatcher correctly finds a plan which never moves b₁ or b₃.

If your landmark analysis insists that *one* of 
   (stack b7 b1), (stack b3 b1), (pick-up b1), … 
must occur, you must *remove* “(on b3 b1)” from the INITIAL state so that the planner is forced to re-establish that relation with a proper stack/unstack/pick-up.  That change belongs in the *problem*, not in the *domain*.

Below is the EXACT SAME domain, which is already correct.  To force the landmark you described you should simply **delete** the line 
       (on b3 b1)
from the problem’s `:init` section.  No change to the domain is necessary.

    :effect (and (on ?x ?y)
                 (clear ?x)
                 (handempty)
                 (not (holding ?x))
                 (not (clear ?y)))
  )

  (:action unstack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (on ?x ?y)
                       (clear ?x)
                       (handempty))
    :effect (and (holding ?x)
                 (clear ?y)
                 (not (on ?x ?y))
                 (not (handempty))
                 (not (clear ?x)))
  )
)
```

**Key Point:**  
– *Domain* stays exactly as above.  
– To *force* a stack/pick-up on b₁ you must remove `(on b3 b1)` from the problem’s `:init`.
