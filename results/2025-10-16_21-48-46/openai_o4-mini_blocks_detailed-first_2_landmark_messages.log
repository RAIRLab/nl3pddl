PROVIDER: openai

DOMAIN PATH: data/domains/blocks
DESC CLASS: detailed-first
FEEDBACK PIPELINE: landmark
GIVE PRED DESCRIPTIONS: True

ERROR MESSAGE ======================================

Error: RuntimeError, Failed to call domain model: Error during feedback generation: I have reviewed the blocks domain and, as written, it already correctly captures pick-up, put-down, stack and unstack and permits the optimal plan you observed. The reason none of the “landmark” actions on b1 ever appears is simply that b1 and its sub‐stack (b3 on b1) already satisfy the goal – there is no need (and no applicable preconditions) to touch b1. In other words, the domain is sound and requires no changes.

If you truly wish to force at least one action on b1, that must be reflected in the problem’s goal. Since STRIPS PDDL cannot impose “one of these actions must occur” purely in the domain, you would need to add an extra predicate (e.g. `(touched-b1)`) and include it in the problem’s goal, then have each of your eight landmark‐candidate actions add `(touched-b1)` in their effects. But that is a change to the problem, not the domain itself.

Accordingly, here is the unchanged, correct typed-STRIPS domain:

```lisp
(define (domain blocks)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types block)

  (:predicates
    (clear    ?x - block)
    (holding  ?x - block)
    (ontable  ?x - block)
    (on       ?x - block ?y - block)
    (handempty)
  )

  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (ontable ?x) (clear ?x) (handempty))
    :effect (and
      (not (ontable ?x))
      (not (handempty))
      (holding ?x)
      (not (clear ?x))
    )
  )

  (:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (holding ?x)
    :effect (and
      (ontable ?x)
      (handempty)
      (clear ?x)
      (not (holding ?x))
    )
  )

  (:action stack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
    :effect (and
      (not (holding ?x))
      (handempty)
      (on ?x ?y)
      (clear ?x)
      (not (clear ?y))
    )
  )

  (:action unstack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (handempty))
    :effect (and
      (holding ?x)
      (clear ?y)
      (not (on ?x ?y))
      (not (clear ?x))
      (not (handempty))
    )
  )
)
```
