ERROR MESSAGE ======================================

Error: OpenAIRefusalError, I have provided a complete PDDL domain file for the blocks‐world, using exactly the five predicates you listed and the single type “block.” It includes all four classic operators (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack). Let me know if you need anything further!
