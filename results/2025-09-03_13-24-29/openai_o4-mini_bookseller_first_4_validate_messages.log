SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a description of the following action in the above described domain.

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The Bookseller domain models the transportation of books via drones to different locations.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[drone, location, book]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(book-at ?b - book ?l - location): A book is at a location., (empty ?d - drone): A drone is empty., (path ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): There is a path between two locations., (last ?b - book ?d - drone): A book is the last (bottom) in a drone's stack., (first ?b - book ?d - drone): A book is the first in a drone's stack., (drone-at ?d - drone ?l - location): A drone is at a location., (ontop ?b1 - book ?b2 - book): One book is directly on top of another.]

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```

    (book-at book3 loc2)

)

```
An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```
(loadfirst drone1 book3 loc1)
(flydrone drone1 loc1 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc5)
(flydrone drone1 loc5 loc4)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc4)
(flydrone drone1 loc4 loc3)
(flydrone drone1 loc3 loc2)
(unloadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc2)

```
The output of the plan validator VAL is:
```
Type-checking load-book
...action passes type checking.
Type-checking pick-up-first-book
...action passes type checking.
Type-checking pick-up-bottom-book
Predicate bottom not found
Conditions fail type-checking.

```
Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
