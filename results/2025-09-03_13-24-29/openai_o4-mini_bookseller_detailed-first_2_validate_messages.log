SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.


AI

    "pddl_action": "(:action pick-up :parameters (?x - block) :precondition (and (ontable ?x) (clear ?x) (handempty)) :effect (and (not (ontable ?x)) (holding ?x) (not (handempty)) (not (clear ?x)))\n)",
    "predicates": ["(handempty)", "(on ?x - block ?y - block)", "(ontable ?x - block)", "(clear ?x - block)", "(holding ?x - block)"],

}


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The Stack action represents the action of stacking a block on top of another block. 

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain operates over a finite set of books, locations, and drones. Drones pick up books at a location and form a stack inside the drone—only the bottom book is accessible—and then transport them along defined paths to deliver them at targeted locations. The goal is to efficiently move all books to a designated location.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[drone, location, book]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(book-at ?b - book ?l - location): Indicates that a particular book is available at a given location, ready for pickup or delivery., (empty ?d - drone): Indicates that the drone is not carrying any books, so it is available to pick up a new book., (path ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): Denotes that a connection exists between two locations, allowing a drone to fly from one to the other., (last ?b - book ?d - drone): Identifies the bottom book in the drone's stack. This book is accessible when loading additional books or when unloading from the bottom., (first ?b - book ?d - drone): Marks that a book, when loaded into a drone, is recognized as the first book in its stack, typically when the drone is initially empty., (drone-at ?d - drone ?l - location): Specifies that a drone is present at a specific location, making it eligible to load or unload books or to fly to another location., (ontop ?b1 - book ?b2 - book): Indicates that a book is stacked directly above another book, establishing the order of books carried by the drone.]

Now you will receive a list of issues with the domain, one at a time. For each issue, generate a corrected version of the full domain that addresses the issue.

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:

    (book-at book3 loc2)
    (book-at book4 loc4)

)

```
An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```
(loadfirst drone1 book3 loc1)
(flydrone drone1 loc1 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc5)
(flydrone drone1 loc5 loc4)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc4)
(flydrone drone1 loc4 loc3)
(flydrone drone1 loc3 loc2)
(unloadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc2)

```
The output of the plan validator VAL is:
```

```
Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
(define (problem bookseller-prob-5loc-4bk-2dr)
  (:domain bookseller)

  (:objects
    book1 book2 book3 book4 - book
    loc1 loc2 loc3 loc4 loc5 - location
    drone1 drone2 - drone
  )

  (:init
    (book-at book1 loc4)

    (book-at book3 loc1)
    (book-at book4 loc5)

    (drone-at drone1 loc1)

    (drone-at drone2 loc3)
    (empty drone2)

    (path loc1 loc5)
    (path loc5 loc1)

    (book-at book2 loc2)
    (book-at book3 loc2)
    (book-at book4 loc4)
  ))

```
An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```
(loadfirst drone1 book3 loc1)
(flydrone drone1 loc1 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc5)
(loadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc5)
(flydrone drone1 loc5 loc4)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc4)
(flydrone drone1 loc4 loc3)
(flydrone drone1 loc3 loc2)
(unloadbottom drone1 book3 book4 loc2)

```
The output of the plan validator VAL is:
