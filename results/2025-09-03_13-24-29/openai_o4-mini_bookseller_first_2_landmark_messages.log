SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The Bookseller domain models the transportation of books via drones to different locations.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[drone, location, book]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(book-at ?b - book ?l - location): A book is at a location., (empty ?d - drone): A drone is empty., (path ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): There is a path between two locations., (last ?b - book ?d - drone): A book is the last (bottom) in a drone's stack., (first ?b - book ?d - drone): A book is the first in a drone's stack., (drone-at ?d - drone ?l - location): A drone is at a location., (ontop ?b1 - book ?b2 - book): One book is directly on top of another.]

Now you will receive a list of issues with the domain, one at a time. For each issue, generate a corrected version of the full domain that addresses the issue.


HUMAN

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
(define (problem bookseller-prob-5loc-4bk-2dr)
  (:domain bookseller)

  (:objects
    book1 book2 book3 book4 - book
    loc1 loc2 loc3 loc4 loc5 - location

  )

  (:init
    (book-at book1 loc4)
    (book-at book2 loc2)
    (book-at book3 loc1)
    (book-at book4 loc5)

    (drone-at drone1 loc1)
    (empty drone1)
    (drone-at drone2 loc3)
    (empty drone2)

    (path loc1 loc5)
    (path loc5 loc1)
    (path loc2 loc3)
    (path loc3 loc2)
    (path loc3 loc4)
    (path loc4 loc3)
    (path loc4 loc5)
    (path loc5 loc4)

    (path loc1 loc5)
  )

  (:goal (and
    (book-at book1 loc4)
    (book-at book2 loc2)
    (book-at book3 loc2)
    (book-at book4 loc4)
  ))
)

```
We expected that the one of the following actions: 
```
(unloadfinal drone1 book2 loc5)
(unloadfinal drone1 book3 loc1)
(unloadfinal drone1 book1 loc4)
(unloadfinal drone1 book1 loc2)
(unloadfinal drone1 book4 loc2)
(unloadfinal drone1 book1 loc5)
(unloadfinal drone1 book4 loc4)
(unloadfinal drone1 book2 loc1)
(unloadfinal drone1 book2 loc2)
(unloadfinal drone1 book4 loc1)
(unloadfinal drone1 book3 loc3)
(unloadfinal drone1 book4 loc5)
(unloadfinal drone1 book3 loc4)
(unloadfinal drone1 book3 loc2)
(unloadfinal drone1 book4 loc3)
(unloadfinal drone1 book2 loc4)
(unloadfinal drone1 book3 loc5)
(unloadfinal drone1 book2 loc3)
(unloadfinal drone1 book1 loc1)
(unloadfinal drone1 book1 loc3) 
```
would be executed in the following plan:
```
{"cost": 11, "actions": ["load drone1 book3 loc1", "fly drone1 loc1 loc5", "fly drone2 loc3 loc4", "fly drone1 loc5 loc4", "fly drone1 loc4 loc3", "fly drone1 loc3 loc2", "drop-only drone1 book3 loc2", "fly drone2 loc4 loc5", "load drone2 book4 loc5", "fly drone2 loc5 loc4", "drop-only drone2 book4 loc4"]}
```

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
