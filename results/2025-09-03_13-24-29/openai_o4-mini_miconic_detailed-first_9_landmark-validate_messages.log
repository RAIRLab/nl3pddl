SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a description of the following action in the above described domain.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain simulates the functioning of an elevator system in a multi-story building. The elevator can move up and down between floors, pick up waiting passengers, and drop them off at their desired destinations. The goal is to transport all passengers to their destination floors efficiently, at which point they are considered served.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[passenger, floor]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(not-boarded ?person - passenger): This predicate indicates that a passenger is waiting to board the elevator and has not yet entered it., (not-served ?person - passenger): This predicate indicates that a passenger has not yet been transported to their destination floor, meaning their journey is incomplete., (boarded ?person - passenger): This predicate indicates that a passenger has entered the elevator and is currently being transported, no longer waiting on their origin floor., (lift-at ?floor - floor): This predicate indicates the current position of the elevator within the building, specifying which floor it is currently located on., (origin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor): This predicate identifies the floor where a passenger initially appears and waits for the elevator, representing their point of entry into the system., (above ?floor1 - floor ?floor2 - floor): This predicate establishes the vertical relationship between floors, indicating that the first floor is exactly one level above the second floor., (destin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor): This predicate identifies the floor where a passenger wants to go, representing their intended exit point from the elevator system., (served ?person - passenger): This predicate indicates that a passenger has been successfully transported to their destination floor and has exited the elevator, completing their journey.]

```
We expected that the one of the following actions: 
```
(board f2 p1) 
```
would be executed in the following plan:
```
{"cost": 9, "actions": ["board-passenger p2 f2", "move-up f2 f1", "board-passenger p1 f1", "move-down f1 f3", "disembark-passenger p2 f3", "disembark-passenger p1 f3", "board-passenger p3 f3", "move-up f3 f2", "disembark-passenger p3 f2"]}
```

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.

An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```
(down f4 f2)
(board f2 p2)
(board f2 p1)
(up f2 f3)
(board f3 p3)
(down f3 f1)
(board f1 p4)
(depart f1 p2)
(up f1 f4)
(depart f4 p3)
(depart f4 p4)
(depart f4 p1)

```
The output of the plan validator VAL is:
```

```
Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
