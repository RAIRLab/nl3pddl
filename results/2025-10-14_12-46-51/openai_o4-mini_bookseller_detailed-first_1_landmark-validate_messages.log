SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

Do not ask the user for any more information or clarifications, you must work with the information provided. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain operates over a finite set of books, locations, and drones. Drones pick up books at a location and form a stack inside the drone—only the bottom book is accessible—and then transport them along defined paths to deliver them at targeted locations. The goal is to efficiently move all books to a designated location.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[drone, location, book]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(ontop ?b1 - book ?b2 - book): Indicates that a book is stacked directly above another book, establishing the order of books carried by the drone., (empty ?d - drone): Indicates that the drone is not carrying any books, so it is available to pick up a new book., (book-at ?b - book ?l - location): Indicates that a particular book is available at a given location, ready for pickup or delivery., (last ?b - book ?d - drone): Identifies the bottom book in the drone's stack. This book is accessible when loading additional books or when unloading from the bottom., (first ?b - book ?d - drone): Marks that a book, when loaded into a drone, is recognized as the first book in its stack, typically when the drone is initially empty., (drone-at ?d - drone ?l - location): Specifies that a drone is present at a specific location, making it eligible to load or unload books or to fly to another location., (path ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): Denotes that a connection exists between two locations, allowing a drone to fly from one to the other.]

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

When a drone is at a location and is empty, and a book is available there, the loadFirst action loads that book into the drone. The book is marked both as the first and the last book in the drone's stack, and it is removed from the location.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output. Remember this must be a typed STRIPS action. You may not use negative preconditions, disjunctive preconditions, or quantified preconditions, nor equality. The generated action thus must not include "or", "forall", "exists", or "=" anywhere.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain:

We expected that the one of the following actions: 
```
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book2 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book2 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book1 loc3)

(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book1 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book3 loc3)
(unloadfinal drone2 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book3 loc3) 
```
would be executed on the following plan, since these actions are a disjunctive action landmark for the problem:
```
(walk loc1 loc3)
```

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```

We expected that the one of the following actions: 
```
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book2 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book2 loc3)

(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book1 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone1 book4 book3 loc3)
(unloadfinal drone2 book4 loc3)
(unloadbottom drone2 book4 book3 loc3) 
```
would be executed on the following plan, since these actions are a disjunctive action landmark for the problem:
```
(start p_3_1 c_1)
(move p_3_1 p_3_0 c_1)
(finish p_3_0 p_4_0 c_1)
(start p_4_1 c_3)

(move p_4_2 p_4_3 c_3)
(move p_4_3 p_4_4 c_3)
(move p_4_4 p_3_4 c_3)
(move p_3_4 p_2_4 c_3)
(move p_2_4 p_1_4 c_3)
(move p_1_4 p_0_4 c_3)
(move p_0_4 p_0_3 c_3)
(move p_0_3 p_0_2 c_3)
(move p_0_2 p_0_1 c_3)
(move p_0_1 p_0_0 c_3)

(move p_2_3 p_1_3 c_2)

(finish p_1_2 p_1_1 c_2)
```

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.

It was found to be unsolvable, but it was expected that the domain should be solvable on this problem. This is an indication that a precondition or effect of an action in the domain are missing.
