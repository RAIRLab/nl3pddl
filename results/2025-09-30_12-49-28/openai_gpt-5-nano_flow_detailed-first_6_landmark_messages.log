Messages ===========================================


SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

Do not ask the user for any more information or clarifications, you must work with the information provided. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.


AI

    "pddl_action": "(:action pick-up :parameters (?x - block) :precondition (and (ontable ?x) (clear ?x) (handempty)) :effect (and (not (ontable ?x)) (holding ?x) (not (handempty)) (not (clear ?x)))\n)",

HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The Stack action represents the action of stacking a block on top of another block. 

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

    "pddl_action": "(:action stack :parameters (?x ?y - block) :precondition (and (clear ?y) (on ?x) (handempty)) :effect (and (not (on ?x)) (not (handempty)) (stacked ?x ?y) (not (clear ?y)))\n)",

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain models the game 'Flow Free,' where the objective is to connect pairs of colored endpoints on a square grid by drawing continuous, non-overlapping paths. To win the game the player must connect all the endpoints and fill the entire board. The board is made up of squares in a grid, and each flow is associated with a particular color.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[location, color]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(color-at ?l - location ?c - color): This predicate indicates that the specified location has been marked with the specified color as part of a flow path., (flow-complete ?c - color): This predicate indicates that the flow for the specified color has been successfully completed by connecting its two endpoints., (not-empty ?l - location): This predicate indicates that the location has already been filled with a color, representing the negation of the empty predicate., (flow-at ?l1 - location ?c - color): This predicate indicates that the player is currently at the specified location drawing a flow of the specified color., (offboard ): This predicate indicates that the player's finger is off the board, allowing them to begin any flow., (empty ?l - location): This predicate indicates that the specified location on the grid has not been filled with any color yet., (flow-end ?l - location ?c - color): This predicate indicates that the specified location is an endpoint (origin or destination) for a flow of the specified color., (adjacent ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): This predicate indicates that one location is directly adjacent to another location on the grid, allowing movement between them.]
