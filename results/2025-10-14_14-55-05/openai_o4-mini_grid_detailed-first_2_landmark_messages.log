Messages ===========================================


SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

Do not ask the user for any more information or clarifications, you must work with the information provided. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain consists of a finite set of interconnected places. The robot can move between places if they are connected, pick up keys, and unlock locked locations whose locks match the shape of the key it carries. The robot starts at one location and must reach a goal location, possibly requiring it to collect and use keys along the way to unlock passages.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[place, shape, key]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(at-robot ?x - place): Indicates the robotâ€™s current position within the grid. At any time, the robot can be located at exactly one place., (holding ?k - key): Indicates that the robot is currently carrying a specific key. While holding a key, the robot cannot pick up another one unless it drops the current one., (locked ?x - place): Marks a place as locked, preventing the robot from entering until it is unlocked using a matching key., (key-shape ?k - key ?s - shape): Each key is associated with a shape that determines which locks it can open. Only a key whose shape matches a lockâ€™s shape can unlock that place., (at ?r - key ?x - place): Represents that a key is lying at a certain location within the grid. The robot can move to this place to pick up the key., (arm-empty ): Shows that the robotâ€™s gripper is empty and can pick up a new key., (conn ?x - place ?y - place): Defines a bidirectional connection between two places, meaning the robot can move directly between them if no lock blocks the way., (lock-shape ?x - place ?s - shape): Defines the shape of the lock associated with a specific place. The place can only be unlocked by a key with the same shape., (open ?x - place): Indicates that the place is unlocked and accessible for the robot to enter or move through.]

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

This action represents basic navigation in the grid. The robot can move between two connected places if the destination is open or has been unlocked. The effect is that the robot changes its position to the new place.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output. Remember this must be a typed STRIPS action. You may not use negative preconditions, disjunctive preconditions, or quantified preconditions, nor equality. The generated action thus must not include "or", "forall", "exists", or "=" anywhere.

HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain:

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain:

Action names do not match the expected action names. 
 Missing actions: pickup-and-loose, putdown, pickup. Extra actions: pickup-key, drop-key.  
 These are the only allowed action names: pickup-and-loose, putdown, unlock, move, pickup.
