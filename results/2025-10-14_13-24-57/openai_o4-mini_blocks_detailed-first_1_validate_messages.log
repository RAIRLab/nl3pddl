SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

Do not ask the user for any more information or clarifications, you must work with the information provided. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

}


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain models a robot manipulating colored blocks on a table. Each block can be either on the table, on top of another block, or held by the robot's arm. The robot can only hold one block at a time, and can only pick up a block if it has nothing on top of it. The robot needs to carefully plan a sequence of pick-up, put-down, and stack operations to achieve desired block configurations. This planning challenge emphasizes spatial reasoning and requires understanding constraints like a block cannot be moved if another block is on top of it.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[block]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(handempty ): This predicate indicates that the robot's hand is not currently holding any block, making it available to pick up a new block. The robot can only hold one block at a time., (on ?x - block ?y - block): This predicate indicates that one block is physically placed directly on top of another block, creating a stack. The block on top is supported by the block beneath it., (ontable ?x - block): This predicate indicates that a block is placed directly on the table surface rather than on top of another block. The table serves as the bottom support for all block configurations., (clear ?x - block): This predicate indicates that a block has no other blocks stacked on top of it, making it accessible to be picked up by the robot arm. Only blocks with this property can be moved., (holding ?x - block): This predicate indicates that the robot has picked up a specific block and is currently holding it in its hand. While holding a block, the robot cannot pick up any other blocks.]

HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

This action allows the robot to lift a block from the table and hold it in its hand. The action can only be performed if the block is on the table, nothing is stacked on top of it, and the robot's hand is currently empty.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output. Remember this must be a typed STRIPS action. You may not use negative preconditions, disjunctive preconditions, or quantified preconditions, nor equality. The generated action thus must not include "or", "forall", "exists", or "=" anywhere.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

This action allows the robot to place a block it is currently holding onto the table surface. After performing this action, the block will be on the table and the robot's hand will be empty again.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

This action allows the robot to lift a block that is currently stacked on top of another block. The block being picked up must be clear (have nothing on top of it), and the robot's hand must be empty before performing this action.

Now you will receive a list of issues with the domain, one at a time. For each issue, generate a corrected version of the full domain that addresses the issue.


HUMAN

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
(define (problem blocks-prob-2)
  (:domain blocks)

  (:objects
    b1 - block
    b2 - block
    b3 - block
    b4 - block
    b5 - block

    (on b1 b2)
    (on b5 b1)
    (clear b5)
    (handempty)
  )

    (on b1 b2)
    (ontable b3)

```
An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```
(unstack b7 b1)
(put-down b7)
(unstack b5 b6)
(put-down b5)
(pick-up b1)
(stack b1 b2)
(pick-up b3)

```
The output of the plan validator VAL is:
```

...action passes type checking.

```
Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
