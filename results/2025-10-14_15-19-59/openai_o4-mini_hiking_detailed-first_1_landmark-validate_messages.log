SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.

Do not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.

Do not ask the user for any more information or clarifications, you must work with the information provided. If you are unsure about something, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty) : nothing is being held by the arm", "(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block ?x is ontop of block ?y", "(ontable ?x - block) : the given block is on the table", "(clear ?x - block) : The given block has nothing ontop of it", "(holding ?x - block) : The arm is holding the given block"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a description of the following action in the above described domain. 

The Stack action represents the action of stacking a block on top of another block. 

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain models a hiking scenario where a hiker can move between adjacent locations along a trail. The environment includes different terrain types, such as hills and water bodies, which may affect the hiker's movement options. The hiker starts at a specific location and must navigate through the trail to reach a goal location. The planning problem focuses on determining a sequence of walking and climbing actions that allow the hiker to successfully traverse the terrain and reach the goal while adhering to the constraints imposed by the terrain features.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[loc]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[(at ?loc - loc): Indicates the hikerâ€™s current position within the hiking area. At any time, the hiker can be located at exactly one place., (isGoal ?loc - loc): Indicates that the location is the goal, which the hiker is trying to reach., (onTrail ?from - loc ?to - loc): Indicates that the location is on the designated hiking trail., (isWater ?loc - loc): Indicates that the location is a water body, which may impede the hiker's movement., (adjacent ?loc1 - loc ?loc2 - loc): Indicates that the two locations are next to each other, allowing for easier movement between them., (isHill ?loc - loc): Indicates that the location is a hill, which may affect the hiker's movement options.]

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

This action initiates walking along the designated trail, allowing the player to explore the hiking area.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output. Remember this must be a typed STRIPS action. You may not use negative preconditions, disjunctive preconditions, or quantified preconditions, nor equality. The generated action thus must not include "or", "forall", "exists", or "=" anywhere.

Based on the actions you have given, the full domain is as follows:


        (define (domain hiking)

            (:types loc)
            (:predicates (at ?loc - loc)

(climbing))

            (:action walk
    :parameters (?from ?to - loc)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?from)
        (adjacent ?from ?to)
        (onTrail ?from ?to)

    :precondition (and (at ?l) (isHill ?l))
    :effect (and (climbing) (not (walking)))
)
        )
    

Now you will receive a list of issues with the domain, one at a time. For each issue, generate a corrected version of the full domain that addresses the issue.


HUMAN

Action names do not match the expected action names. 
 Missing actions: climb. Extra actions: start-walking, start-climbing.  
 These are the only allowed action names: climb, walk.
 Please revise the domain and try again.

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
;; Hiking problem generator
;; Locations: 3, Hills: 1, Waters: 1, Seed: None

(define (problem hiking-problem-3-1-1)
  (:domain hiking)

  (:objects
    loc1 - loc
    loc2 - loc
    loc3 - loc
  )

  (:init
    (at loc1)
    (adjacent loc1 loc3)
    (adjacent loc3 loc1)
    (isHill loc2)
    (isGoal loc3)
  )

  (:goal (at loc3))

)
```
It was found to be unsolvable, but it was expected that the domain should be solvable with this problem. This is an indication that a precondition or effect of an action in the domain are missing.

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements or actions to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
