SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.


HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty)", "(on ?x - block ?y - block)", "(ontable ?x - block)", "(clear ?x - block)", "(holding ?x - block)"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a desc described action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need, generate a desc described action in the above described domain. 

The Stack action represents the action of stacking a block on top of another block. 

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain operates over a finite set of books, locations, and drones. Drones pick up books at a location and form a stack inside the drone—only the bottom book is accessible—and then transport them along defined paths to deliver them at targeted locations. The goal is to efficiently move all books to a designated location.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[location, drone, book]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[empty: Indicates that the drone is not carrying any books, so it is available to pick up a new book., path: Denotes that a connection exists between two locations, allowing a drone to fly from one to the other., book-at: Indicates that a particular book is available at a given location, ready for pickup or delivery., drone-at: Specifies that a drone is present at a specific location, making it eligible to load or unload books or to fly to another location.]

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

When a drone is at a location and is empty, and a book is available there, the loadFirst action loads that book into the drone. The book is marked both as the first and the last book in the drone's stack, and it is removed from the location.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

If a drone already carries a book (marked as last) and another book is available at the same location, the loadBottom action allows the drone to load the new book underneath the existing stack. This action updates the previous bottom book by removing its 'last' status, marks it as 'ontop' of the new book, and sets the new book as the last in the stack.

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.
