Messages ===========================================


content='You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: \n1. A string containing a raw PDDL action \n2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types\n3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.\n\nThe JSON object should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",\n    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]\n    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]\n}\n\nIf you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action. Ensure the generated domain is fully lowercase and that all parentheses are balanced.\n\nDo not refuse to answer and do not ask any questions to the user, since the user is an automated tool that can not respond as a human would.

This is an indication that a precondition or effect of an action in the domain are missing.\n\nPlease revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={}content='{"pddl_domain": "(define (domain miconic)\\n    (:requirements :strips :typing)\\n    (:types passenger\\nfloor)\\n    (:predicates (origin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor)\\n(destin ?person - passenger ?floor - floor)\\n(lift-at ?floor - floor)\\n(above ?floor1 - floor ?floor2 - floor)\\n(served ?person - passenger)\\n(not-served ?person - passenger)\\n(boarded ?person - passenger)\\n(not-boarded ?person - passenger)\\n(on-floor ?person - passenger ?floor - floor))\\n\\n    (:action board :parameters (?person - passenger ?floor - floor) :precondition (and (lift-at ?floor) (not-boarded ?person)) :effect (and (boarded ?person) (not (not-boarded ?person)) (on-floor ?person ?floor)))\\n    (:action depart :parameters (?person - passenger ?floor - floor) :precondition (and (lift-at ?floor) (boarded ?person) (destin ?person ?floor)) :effect (and (served ?person) (not (boarded ?person)) (not (on-floor ?person ?floor))))\\n    (:action up :parameters (?current - floor ?next - floor) :precondition (and (lift-at ?current) (above ?current ?next)) :effect (and (not (lift-at ?current)) (lift-at ?next)))\\n    (:action down :parameters (?current - floor ?next - floor) :precondition (and (lift-at ?current) (above ?next ?current)) :effect (and (not (lift-at ?current)) (lift-at ?next)))\\n)"}' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={}
