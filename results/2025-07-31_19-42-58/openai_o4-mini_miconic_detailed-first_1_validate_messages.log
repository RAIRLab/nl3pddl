SYSTEM

You will be given a natural language description of an a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain along with a set of types and predicates you are allowed to use. You will then be given a description of each action in the domain, including its parameter count and types. With this, your goal is to generate a PDDL action for this description filling in the preconditions and effects. You are allowed to create new predicates and types as needed but must include the set of all predicates and types you used in the output. For your output please provide a JSON object with the following felids: 
1. A string containing a raw PDDL action 
2. A list of predicates used so far with all parameters and types
3. A list of types used so far, we assume there is no type hierarchy.

The JSON object should be formatted as follows:
{
    "pddl_action": "(:action <action_name> ...)",
    "predicates": ["(pred1 ?param1 - type1 ?param2 - type2)", ...]
    "types" : ["type1", "type2", ...]
}

If you mess up the formatting or output invalid PDDL, you will receive a message instructing you on what is wrong and how you may fix it, at which point you should try to generate the PDDL action again, you will be requested to fix the issue until you generate a valid PDDL action.

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

["(handempty)", "(on ?x - block ?y - block)", "(ontable ?x - block)", "(clear ?x - block)", "(holding ?x - block)"]

You may also use the following types:

["block"]


HUMAN

Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a desc described action in the above described domain. 

The pick-up action represents the action of a robot arm picking up a single block from the table

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output.

HUMAN

The following is a natural language description of a PDDL domain:

This domain simulates the functioning of an elevator system in a multi-story building. The elevator can move up and down between floors, pick up waiting passengers, and drop them off at their desired destinations. The goal is to transport all passengers to their destination floors efficiently, at which point they are considered served.

To start you may use the following types but are free to add more:

[floor, passenger]                                         

To start you may use the following predicates but are free to add more:

[not-boarded: This predicate indicates that a passenger is waiting to board the elevator and has not yet entered it., served: This predicate indicates that a passenger has been successfully transported to their destination floor and has exited the elevator, completing their journey., lift-at: This predicate indicates the current position of the elevator within the building, specifying which floor it is currently located on., above: This predicate establishes the vertical relationship between floors, indicating that the first floor is exactly one level above the second floor., not-served: This predicate indicates that a passenger has not yet been transported to their destination floor, meaning their journey is incomplete., origin: This predicate identifies the floor where a passenger initially appears and waits for the elevator, representing their point of entry into the system., destin: This predicate identifies the floor where a passenger wants to go, representing their intended exit point from the elevator system.]

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.

Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
(define (problem miconic-prob-4f-4p)
  (:domain miconic)

  (:objects
    p1 p2 p3 p4 - passenger
    f1 f2 f3 f4 - floor
  )

  (:init
    (origin p1 f2)
    (destin p1 f4)
    (not-boarded p1)
    (not-served p1)
    (origin p2 f2)
    (destin p2 f1)
    (not-boarded p2)
    (not-served p2)
    (origin p3 f3)
    (destin p3 f4)
    (not-boarded p3)
    (not-served p3)
    (origin p4 f1)
    (destin p4 f4)

    (not-served p4)
    (above f1 f2)

  (:goal (and
    (served p1)

An issue was encountered with the following plan:
```

(depart f5 p3)
(depart f5 p4)

The output of the plan validator VAL is:
```
