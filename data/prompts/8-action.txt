Using the current list of predicates and any new predicates you feel you need,generate a PDDL action for the following action description in the above described domain: 

{action_nl}

Regardless of whether you create any new predicates, include the set of all predicates used so far in the output. Remember this must be a typed STRIPS action. You may not use negative preconditions, disjunctive preconditions, or quantified preconditions, nor equality. The generated action thus must not include "or", "forall", "exists", or "=" anywhere.
