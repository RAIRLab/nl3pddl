Given a template of a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planning domain and a natural language description of that domain,
fill in the types and predicates as well as the missing preconditions and effects for each action in the domain using the provided natural language description.

The following restrictions apply to the output:
1) You are only to output PDDL, and nothing else. You are to output the domain as raw text, with no additional formatting.
2) You are to use the provided template as a base, and only fill in the missing preconditions and effects for each action.
3) The output domain should be typed STRIPS, which means that the preconditions should only contain positive literals, do not include any negated preconditions, or quantified preconditions or effects.
