Given the above domain you just generated, attempting to use it with the following problem:
```
{problem}
```
We expected that the following action {landmark} would be executed in the following plan:
```
{plan}
```

Please revise the previous domain to fix the issue. You may create new predicates and types if needed, but make sure to update the predicate and type lists accordingly. You may not add new requirements to the domain, your output should exclusively be a typed STRIPS domain.
