        "first": "The Pacman domain involves navigating a maze-like environment to collect food by moving between connected positions and eating food items when available.",
        "detailed-first": "This domain models Pacman’s movement through a grid of connected positions where he can explore and collect food. Pacman starts at a given location and can move to adjacent positions if they are connected. Some positions contain food, which Pacman can eat when he reaches them. The planning problem focuses on finding an efficient sequence of moves and eat actions that allow Pacman to visit necessary locations and collect all food items. This setup captures spatial navigation, reachability, and resource collection behavior."
