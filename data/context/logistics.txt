The domain assumes a world where there are a set of packages that must be
transported between various locations using vehicles. Two types of vehicles
operate in this world: trucks, which travel on roads between nearby locations,
and airplanes, which fly between more distant locations (typically airports).


predicates:
in-city: Indicates that a location is within a specific city.
at: Indicates that an object (truck, airplane, or package) is at a specific
location.
in: Indicates that a package is inside a vehicle (truck or airplane).

Actions:
load-truck: Allows a truck to load a package at a location if both the
package and the truck are present there. After the load-truck action, the
package is no longer at the location but is inside the truck.

unload-truck: Allows a truck to unload a package at a location if the truck
is present there and carrying the package. After the unload-truck action, the
package is placed at that location.

road network. After the drive-truck action, the truckâ€™s location is updated to
the destination.
