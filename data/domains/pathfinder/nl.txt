The pathfinder domain models a puzzle game where an agent must get from one location to another in a grid environment 
with walls and pressure plates. Once the agent starts moving in a direction it can not stop until it hits a wall. If the agent
passes over a pressure plate while in motion, it will replace the location of the pressure plate with the wall. While the classic
game is two dimensional, this version can be made to be n-dimensional.

The domain has 4 actions
1. motion-start: starts the agent moving in one direction
2. motion-clear: if the space in front of the agent is clear and the agent is in motion, the agent will move into the space.
3. motion-plate: if the space in front of the agent is a pressure plate and the agent is in motion, the agent will move onto the plate and the plate will be replaced with a wall.
4. motion-wall: if the agent moves into a wall, the agent stops at the position before the wall and is no longer moving.
