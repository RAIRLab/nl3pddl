Given the following problem in the domain:

It should be solvable by the following plan:
(motion-start n)
(motion-clear l9 l5 n)
(motion-wall l5 l1 n)
(motion-start e)
(motion-plate l5 l6 e)
(motion-clear l6 l7 e)
(motion-clear l7 l8 e)
(motion-wall l8 lw e)
(motion-start w)
(motion-clear l8 l7 w)
(motion-wall l7 l6 w)
(motion-start n)
(motion-clear l7 l3 n)

However, it fails with the following error:
Type-checking motion-clear
...action passes type checking.
Type-checking motion-start
...action passes type checking.
Type-checking motion-plate
...action passes type checking.
Type-checking motion-wall
...action passes type checking.

Plan failed to execute

Plan Repair Advice:

(motion-clear l6 l7 e) has an unsatisfied precondition at time 6
(Set (in-motion e) to true)
