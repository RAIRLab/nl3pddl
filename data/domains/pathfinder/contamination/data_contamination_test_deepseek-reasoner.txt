This domain:
1. Defines two types: locations and directions
2. Uses two predicates:
   - `connected` to model directional paths between locations
   - `at` to track current position
3. Implements a `move` action that:
   - Requires being at the source location and having a connection
   - Updates the character's position when moving through valid connections

The STRIPS-style operators ensure the planner can efficiently compute paths through the celestial locations while maintaining proper typing constraints.
