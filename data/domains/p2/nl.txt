The Lukasiewicz P2 domain models proving propositional formulae in a Hilbert system using the axioms provided by Lukasiewicz's P2.
The domain operates over a finite number of propositional formulae, which may be composed into more complex formulae using implication and negation.
Since implication and negation are functionally complete, any propositional formula can be represented in this domain after a translation. 

The domain contains the following actions:
1. def_imp: Defines an implication formula given two defined formulae.
2. def_neg: Defines a negation formula given a defined formula.
3. a1: The first of three axioms in Lukasiewicz's P2, which states that
   if a formulae is in the form p implies q and q implies p, then p is provable.
4. a2: The second of three axioms in Lukasiewicz's P2, which states that if a formulae
   is in the form p implies q, q implies r, r implies p, p implies q, q implies p, and
p implies r, then p implies r is provable.
5. a3: The third of three axioms in Lukasiewicz's P2, which states that if a formulae
   is in the form not p implies not q, then q implies p is provable.
6. mp: Modus ponens, which states that if p implies q and p are provable, then q is provable.
