        "first": "The Pacman AI domain models a competitive environment where Pacman navigates a network of connected nodes, collects food, and avoids opponents such as ghosts and other Pacmen.",
        "detailed-first": "This domain represents a strategic version of Pacman where multiple entities interact within a graph-based map. Pacman can move between connected nodes, collect food items from adjacent positions, and must avoid dangerous nodes containing opponent ghosts or rival Pacmen. The goal typically involves navigating safely, maximizing food collection, and potentially outmaneuvering opponents. The domain emphasizes intelligent movement, risk assessment, and efficient pathfinding in a dynamic and adversarial environment."

Pacman cannot eat food if the target node contains a ghost. After the action, Pacman ends up at the food node, the food is removed from that node, and the node is marked as visited."
