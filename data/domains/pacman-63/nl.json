        "first": "The Pacman AI STRIPS domain models a competitive environment where Pacman navigates a network of connected nodes, collects food, and avoids opponents such as ghosts.",
        "detailed-first": "This STRIPS domain represents a strategic version of Pacman where multiple entities interact within a graph-based map. Pacman can move between connected nodes, collect food items from adjacent positions, and must avoid nodes containing opponent ghosts. Complementary predicates such as 'no_food', 'safe_from_ghost', and 'not_at' are used to eliminate negations in preconditions and effects. The goal typically involves navigating safely, maximizing food collection, and marking visited nodes."
