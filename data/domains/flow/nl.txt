The domain models the game "Flow Free," where the objective is to connect pairs
of colored endpoints on a square grid by drawing continuous, non-overlapping paths.
To win the game the player must connect all the endpoints and fill the entire 
board. The board is made up of individual locations, and each flow is associated with
a particular color.

The domain includes three actions:
1. start: Begins a flow by placing the player's finger on an empty endpoint
of a specific color. This action initiates the drawing of a path from that
endpoint.

2. move: Extends an active flow by moving the finger from its current
location to an adjacent empty location, marking the new cell with the flow's
color as the path continues.

3. finish: Completes an active flow by connecting the drawn path to a
matching colored endpoint. This action finishes the flow by moving the finger
into an adjacent empty endpoint, marking it with the flowâ€™s color and
finalizing the connection.
