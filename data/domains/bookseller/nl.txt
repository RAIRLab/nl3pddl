The Bookseller domain models the transportation of books via drones to different locations. 
The domain operates over a finite number of books, locations, and drones. Each drone can hold a stack of books, 
but only the bottom book can be accessed at any time. The goal is to transport all books to a specific location.

The domain contains the following actions:
1. loadFirst: A drone picks up the first book at a location.
2. loadBottom: A drone picks up the bottom book at a location.
4. unloadFinal: A drone drops off the top and final book at a location.
5. unloadBottom: A drone drops off the bottom book at a location.
6. flyDrone: A drone flies from one location to another.
